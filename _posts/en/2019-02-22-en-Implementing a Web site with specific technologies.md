A useful challenge to rebuild the book's search system.

### Implementing technologies to complete the project

This system is basically a data base. (Big Data)

Because it contains about a million information book information.
And the goal is to be able to search the books with great speed.



I hope that this cultural project can also be a positive step for the development of the literary culture.
